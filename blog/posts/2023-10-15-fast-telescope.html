      Last month I was fortunate to receive observing time on the FAST telescope
      - my first time using the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.
      This article documents the entire process from proposal preparation to
      data acquisition, as well as preliminary data analysis results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FAST (Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) is located in
      Guizhou, China, and has been operational since 2016. With its massive
      500-meter diameter, it's particularly sensitive to faint radio signals
      from pulsars and neutral hydrogen in distant galaxies.
    </p>
    <h4>Proposal Preparation</h4>
    <p>
      The proposal process was rigorous, requiring detailed justification of the
      scientific objectives and technical feasibility. I spent several weeks
      preparing the observing plan, including target selection, integration time
      calculations, and data reduction strategies.
    </p>
    <h4>On-site Experience</h4>
    <p>
      Visiting the FAST site was awe-inspiring. The telescope's scale is
      difficult to comprehend until you see it in person. The support staff were
      incredibly knowledgeable and helpful throughout the observing run.
    </p>
    <h4>Preliminary Results</h4>
    <p>
      The data quality exceeded expectations. We detected several new pulsar
      candidates and gathered valuable data on neutral hydrogen distribution in
      our target galaxy cluster. Analysis is ongoing, but the initial results
      are promising.
